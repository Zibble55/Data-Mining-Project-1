# Data-Mining-Project-1
Utilized different regression techniques to observe differences in methods. Includes shrinkage and dimension reduction methods.

Data utilized in the simulation was randomly generated with 70 percent of the rows being used as training data and the rest being test data.

Each scenario is repeated three times with varying levels of standard deviation for noise generation.

Scenario 1 has the true model having 15 significant variables out of the 15 variables. 
Scenario 2 has the true model having 4 significant variables out of the 700 variables.
